# Usability-Hubs-Clone

# Project Overview
usability-hubs-clone is a replica of the usabilityhub website, designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development. this project focuses on recreating the user interface and experience of the original site using html, css, and vanilla javascript. the goal was to develop a responsive and interactive website that closely mimics the design and functionality of usabilityhub.

# Objectives
- **practice front-end development:** to apply my knowledge of html, css, and javascript in building a complex web project.
- **responsive design:** to ensure the website adapts seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes.
- **user interface:** to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface similar to the original usabilityhub website.
- **functionality:** to implement interactive elements using vanilla javascript to enhance user engagement.

# Technologies Used
- **html:** for structuring the content and layout of the web pages.
- **css:** for styling the website, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive. this includes the use of flexbox and grid for layout management.
